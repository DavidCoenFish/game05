A. master_pos_texture: a texture for position, orientation, bounding sphere radius 
B. object_texture: reference A, other data for instance? rbga?

texture A, and uspport data B is handed off to renderer
for physics step, we want to generate a new master_pos_texture, frame or time plus one
collect forces on objects, track collision pairs? forces[gravity, intersection push out, maintain link lengths, springs, player controller hover height]

position could make a hash, but how to collect items in position bucket?
can you additivly render to a float texture
