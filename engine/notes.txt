TextBlock/ TextGeometry could have no concept of render target? allow draw to screen or ui block?
would this allow ui_block to be more generic, holds the render target and some compisition info, that is the pixel size

ui_hierarchy
i_ui_hierarchy_node
    ui_hierarchy_node_text
        ui_block
    ui_hierarchy_node_fill
    ui_hierarchy_node_drop_shadow
    ?ui_hierarchy_node_margin
    ?auto scroll
    ?interactive scroll
    ?stack
    ?grid
