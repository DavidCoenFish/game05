- rebuild "update layout" logic to not run unless something changes
    other than UIData changes, the inputs to UIComponent are [time, ui scale, texture size, <locale, but that may be upstream of UIData>]
    state may also be changed by input, ie, hover over state flag, click down
    -change of input state needs to set render dirty flag 

    -don't change contentent with time, what about auto scroll
    - is auto scroll done in UIData or UIComponent, thought it was ui component. 
    UpdateResource is fully recursive and does the scroll tick and the fade tick, if these change render state, set needs to render up the stack

    if input state changes, need to mark as needs to render, see 

    so, do components need a parent link so layout changes can propergate upwards? what about resource/ render dirty
    or, so we move layout dirty flag into node?

    can we move the common properties, like layout, out of UIComponent and into node? or node child?
    some of the point of having component and node split was so that there could be a root node at the top of the hierarchy
    root node having geometry didn't make sense so geometry was pulled out

- pollish pass on text placement, 
    check wrap
    clean up EM align (modify "zero" row of font glyph texture?)

//v2, 
UIHierarchyNode // N0 
    <_input state>
    _texture // T0 the texture for N0, the children A0 draw to this using there geometry G1. size is from external, such as screen size
    _effect_stack // E0, use T0 as input, and perform an effect step for each item in stack
    // if we had layout here, it would be redundant for root node
    _child_node_array // A1, UIHierarchyNodeChild
    [
        _component // C1, special rules for layout and rendering for each different component type
                   // tooltip manager may want to intercept update hierarchy, else it could modify the children of the uidata is it matched with? callback, or store changes to update called?
        _layout/other common stuff of _component to allow component to move to pure interface rather than have inherited functionality
        _shader_constant_buffer
        _geometry
        _node
    ]

UIData gets flags [hierarchy change, layout change, render change (for param change in effect? in which case, have a effect change), and also an enum just for dirty/ dont skip in UpdateHierarchyLayout, ie, some decendent has an active flag]
UpdateHierarchyLayout 
    // query? mark node textures as dirty on change, ie, all we can flag in UIComponent hierarchy is mark texture dirty
UpdateResource 
    // no uidata at this point, use resource update to change texture size, geometry, and apply tick to fade and auto scroll (and components that want a tick?)
    // visits every node, kind of needs to as difficult to track what nodes may have a tick for auto scroll
    // however, we do know what when manual scroll is turned on in UpdateHierarchyLayout, have a UIComponent flag for needs tick/ decendent needs tick?
    // -DependantDirty need to recurse to children
    // -SizeResource ~ layout change, hierarchy created. need to update texture and geometry sizes
    // -TickFade
    // -TickScroll
Draw
    // any texture  that has not been drawn or with "always dirty" flag set get visited, needs to have been applyed up the tree


example A
N0 // Top level node
 _T0 // backbuffer
 _A0
  _C1 text
  _N1
   _T1

example B
N0 // Top level node
 _T0 // backbuffer
 _A0
  _C1 shrunk canvas with margin
  _E1 drop shadow
  _N1
   _T1
   _A1
    _C2 text with margin


layout
case A. red quad quater size of screen, with text "hello human" in the center internally.
case B. tooltip somewhere on screen, want margin around text block.
case C. tooltip 2, want margin around text block, then another margin with dropshadow

text component is source of desired size, text bounds  example 90,10
margin 5 added to desired size from component, so  100,20
wrapping component, uilayout size 0,0 but set to expand, use child size as desired 100,20 via component?
wrapping component margin 5, 

node::update layout (in parent window)
    for each child A0
        component::update layout
            calculate layout size given parent window
            recurse node::update layout
            component::desired(parent window or layout size? layout size may yet to be modified...)
            finialise layout size (shrink/expand)


component calculates the texture size it wants, based on parent window, and contents
component calculates geometry based on parent window, texture size, uv scroll

layout size is a starting point, ratio of parent window
parent_window_pivot (float2)
texture_attach (float2)

text component has a desired size (text bounds) 
we want a canvas around it? or the UIComponent itself gets the margin?
for C'N' want to add the margin to the texture T'N', adjusting G'N + 1' (child geometry/ parent window offset)
so a default margin would generate a parent size, offset and window inset by the margin?

uilayout
    UICoord[2] layout size
    float2 layout attach
    float2 parent pivot
    adjust rules // enum shrink, shrink/grow. grow // how to adjust the layout size given the texture size
    texture margin






aim of layout, is the specification of the geometry size to draw the child to the parent
desired size is the texture size of the child.
use uvscroll to position texture on 


UpdateTextureSize(before_shrink_layout_size_hint) //, enum shrink x, enum shrink y)
UpdateLayout(parent size, parent offset, parent window)


N0 // node
 _T0 // ui texture, the backbuffer or a render target
 _A0 // child array
  _C1 // component
  _E1 // effect stack
  _N1 // Recurse back to node with texture and child array

layout

case A. red quad quater size of screen, with text "hello human" in the center internally.
N0
 _T0 //backbuffer
 _A0
   _C1 // red quad canvas, uilayout - quater of screen
   _N1
    _T1 // texture size of red quad
    _A1
     _C2 // text component,  uilayout - shrink
     _N2
      _T2 // texture for text manager to draw C2 text block to, size from text block, but constrained to T1

case B. tooltip somewhere on screen, want margin around text block. // 3 nodes
N0
 _T0 //backbuffer
 _A0
   _C1 // grey quad somewhere on screen with margin around _C2 texture size, shrink to _T2 size plus margin from _C2
   _N1
    _T1
    _A1
     _C2 // text component, shrink
     _N2
      _T2 // texture for text manager to draw C2 text block

// lets try 2 nodes
N0 
 _T0 //backbuffer
 _A0
   _C1 // text component with margin, shrink. draw grey background
   _E1 // round corners...
   _N1
    _T1 texture for text manager to draw C1 text block

a component shrinks to it's children size, but UIComponentText has a text block instead of node children
UIComponentCanvas (ie, IUIComponent default implementation) uses zero or are implementation of Desired size special?
when handing down plack holder layout size for desired size/ texture size calculation, don't perform shrink

case C. tooltip 2, want margin around text block, then another margin with dropshadow



UIData change, trigger dirty 
once it gets to the component, always do a full visit on
