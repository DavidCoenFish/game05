need to hold onto renderer IResource till command list is done.
add to DrawSystem a ResourceBucket, which we keep alive till fence is passed
make shader param instancable, is Shader::MakeParamInstance, Shader::SetParam

X renderer resource bucket and fence
    - fix stack
- ui system button
- shader param instance
- ui fade in
- ui fade/blur out effect for destroyed uitextures
- slider (ui scale)
- combobox dropdown (choose locale)
- character selection screen
- blob renderer
- personality decal
- shadow blob (folds upward to look around, laughs, eyes track mouse pointer...)
